Based on the findings, the team formulated a strategy, which included defining a set of principles to drive culture change, as well as training and supervising representatives on fair dealing. The Board endorsed the strategy, and its implementation progress was updated on a quarterly basis. Supervisory expectations: The Board and Senior Management should assign responsibilities to specific and suitably senior executive(s) for carrying out initiatives to promote fair dealing practices within a financial institution. For example, assigning a specific and suitably senior executive or the formation of a team dedicated to achieving fair dealing outcomes, as well as overt support from Board and Senior Management for fair dealing initiatives, are some ways to demonstrate a financial institution’s commitment to fair dealing. Guidelines on Fair Dealing | 8 c) With respect to managing service quality and customer feedback – • Transparent pricing and fee structures ; • Clear service standards for processing key service deliverables to customers (e.g., processing of insurance claims); • Procedures for whistle-blowers to report misconduct; and • Frameworks and procedures to effectively process and resolve complaints in an independent and timely manner.\n",

The Board instructed that special attention be paid to remuneration structures, disclosure standards and product selection process, as these areas have greater impact on customers’ interests. Arising from the review, the financial institution established a formal process to gather customer feedback, and a regular forum to discuss market conduct related matters. Quarterly customer forums were set up, with the objective of gathering customer feedback on the quality of marketing materials and financial advisory experience. A report summarising the findings and suggested corrective actions from each forum was discussed at quarterly Board meetings. All matters relating to market conduct (e.g., compliance records, non-sales related performance indicators) were also discussed.

An example is an extremely time limited website promotional offer, accompanied by language highlighting that the limited deal is running out, which could unduly encourage hasty purchases by customers without sufficient consideration of his/her needs or suitability. 3 Where an application is rejected due to money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing concerns, financial institutions should take steps to ensure that their communication with the customer does not constitute “tipping off” under section 57 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. For instance, the specific source of concern or information on any ongoing or potential investigation should not be disclosed to the customer.\n",

This consideration was also included in the design of its system user interface that directly marketed products to the end consumer. 2 Supervisory expectations: The Board and Senior Management should ensure that all marketing materials provide customers with a fair and balanced description of the product or service offered. The Board and Senior Management should also ensure that there are no pressure, scare or other unethical sales tactics employed when dealing with customers.

      "1-4          Key Concepts 1-4-1 Money laundering (“ML”) is a process intended to mask the benefits derived from criminal conduct so that they appear to have originated from a legitimate source. Singapore’s primary legislation to combat ML is the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992. A bank should refer to the Commercial Affairs Department’s (“CAD”) website for more information. 1-4-2 Generally, the process of ML comprises three stages, namely ― (a) Placement – The physical or financial disposal of the benefits derived from criminal conduct. (b) Layering – The separation of these benefits from their original source by creating layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the ultimate source and transfer of these benefits. (c) Integration – The provision of apparent legitimacy to the benefits derived from criminal conduct. If the layering process succeeds, the integration schemes place the laundered funds back into the economy so that they re-enter the financial system appearing to be legitimate funds.\n",

      "Text:\n",
      "2-3 When performing Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) measures in the scenarios below, the following approaches may be adopted: (a) Portfolio Managers bank may encounter cases where, to its knowledge, the customer is a manager of a portfolio of assets and who is operating the account in that capacity. In such cases, the underlying investors of the portfolio shall be beneficial owners within the meaning of the Notice. However, the Authority recognises that a bank may not be able to perform CDD measures on the underlying investors. For instance, the portfolio manager may be reluctant, for commercial reasons, to reveal information on the underlying investors to the bank. In such circumstances, the bank should evaluate the risks arising from each case and determine the appropriate CDD measures to take. The bank may consider whether simplified CDD (“SCDD”) measures could be applied to underlying investors under paragraph 7 of the Notice. However, where the customer falls within paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, the bank is exempted from making inquiries about the existence of such underlying investors (i.e. beneficial owners). Therefore, the bank does not need to identify and verify such underlying investors. (b) Credit or Charge Card Customers Where a bank issues a credit card or a charge card as defined in section 56 of the Banking Act 1970, or a particular type of credit card or charge card defined in regulation 2 of the Banking (Credit Card and Charge Card) Regulations 2013 (such as a business card, business card with no personal liability, corporate card, guarantee card, corporate card with no personal liability, corporate purchasing card, guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card), the following are customers for the purposes of the Notice: (i) the principal credit card or charge card holder; 6 (ii) any supplementary credit card or charge card holder; (iii) any employee to whom the business card is issued; (iv) the sole proprietor or partnership which bears liability for the business card issued; (v) any employee or officer of a body corporate to whom the corporate card is issued, and the body corporate; and (vi) the guarantor of any guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card. merchant for whom the bank opens or maintains an account (including a ledger account) for the purchase of goods by, or provision of services to, any person from the merchant, using any credit card or charge card, should be considered a customer for the purposes of the Notice. (c) Location of Relationship Management Given the globalised nature of modern banking, it may often be the case that a bank’s relationship and transactions with a particular customer is managed by a bank employee or officer based in one country or jurisdiction but the account itself is held with an office in another country or jurisdiction for bookkeeping purposes. The Authority will generally look at the substance of the relationship management as a whole. A bank should perform the applicable CDD measures if in substance, the relationship or account is managed by an employee or officer of the bank in Singapore even though the account is booked in another country or jurisdiction. However, the bank may rely on the CDD measures carried out by its related entity (or in the case of a branch network, another branch of the bank) in accordance with paragraph 9 of the Notice.\n",

The bank should ensure that any document that is critical for performance of any measures required under the Notice is translated into English by a suitably qualified translator. Alternatively, the bank may rely on a translation of such document by a bank staff independent of the customer relationship who is conversant in that foreign language. This is to allow all employees and officers of the bank involved in the performance of any measures required under the Notice to understand the contents of the documents, for effective determination and evaluation of ML/TF risks associated with the customer. 6-6-8 The bank should ensure that documents obtained for performing any measures required under the Notice are clear and legible.

It may be based on a threshold (e.g. any person owning more than 25% of the legal person or legal arrangement, taking into account any aggregated ownership for companies with cross-shareholdings). 6-8-3 A natural person who does not meet the shareholding threshold referred to in paragraph 6-8-2 above but who controls the customer (e.g. through exercising significant influence), is a beneficial owner under the Notice. 6-8-4 A bank may also consider obtaining an undertaking or declaration from the customer on the identity of, and the information relating to, the beneficial owner. Notwithstanding the obtaining of such an undertaking or declaration, the bank remains responsible for complying with its obligations under the Notice to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner by, for example, researching publicly available information on the beneficial owner or arranging a face-to-face meeting with the beneficial owner, to corroborate the undertaking or declaration provided by the customer. 6-8-5 Where the customer is not a natural person and has a complex ownership or control structure, a bank should obtain enough information to sufficiently understand if there are legitimate reasons for such ownership or control structure. 6-8-6 A bank should take particular care when dealing with companies with bearer shares, since the beneficial ownership is difficult to establish. For such companies, a bank should adopt procedures to establish the identities of the beneficial owners of such shares and ensure that the bank is notified whenever there is a change of beneficial owner of such shares. At a minimum, these procedures should require 19 the bank to obtain an undertaking in writing from the beneficial owner of such bearer shares stating that the bank shall be immediately notified if the shares are transferred to another natural person, legal person or legal arrangement. Depending on its risk assessment of the customer, the bank may require that the bearer shares be held by a named custodian, with an undertaking from the custodian that the bank will be notified of any changes to ownership of these shares or the named custodian. 6-8-7 For the purposes of paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, where the customer is a legal person publicly listed on a stock exchange and subject to regulatory disclosure requirements relating to adequate transparency in respect of its beneficial owners (imposed through stock exchange rules, law or other enforceable means), it is not necessary to identify and verify the identities of the beneficial owners of the customer. 6-8-8 In determining if the foreign stock exchange imposes regulatory disclosure and adequate transparency requirements, the bank should put in place an internal assessment process with clear criteria, taking into account, amongst others, the country risk and the level of the country’s compliance with the FATF standards. 6-8-9 Where the customer is a majority-owned subsidiary of a publicly listed legal person, it is not necessary to identify and verify the identities of beneficial owners of the customer. However, for such a customer, if there are other non-publicly listed legal persons who own more than 25% of the customer or who otherwise control the customer, the beneficial owners of such non-publicly listed legal persons should be identified and verified. 6-8-10  Deleted with effect from 30 November 2015. 6-8-11  Deleted with effect from 30 November 2015. 6-8-12  Where a customer is one which falls within paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, this does not in itself constitute an adequate analysis of low ML/TF risks for the purpose of performing SCDD measures under paragraph 7 of the Notice.\n",

For example, frequent transfers of funds to the same recipient over a short period of time, multiple deposits of cash such that the amount of each deposit is not substantial, but the total of which is substantial. 6-10-3  Where there are indications that the risks associated with an existing business relations may have increased, the bank should request additional information and conduct a review of the customer’s risk profile in order to determine if additional measures are necessary. 6-10-4  A key part of ongoing monitoring includes maintaining relevant and up-to-date CDD data, documents and information so that the bank can identify changes to the customer’s risk profile ― (a) for higher risk categories of customers, a bank should obtain updated CDD information (including updated copies of the customer’s passport or identity documents if these have expired), as part of its periodic CDD review, or upon the occurrence of a trigger event as deemed necessary by the bank, whichever is earlier; and (b) for all other risk categories of customers, a bank should obtain updated CDD information upon the occurrence of a trigger event. 6-10-5  Examples of trigger events are when (i) a significant transaction takes place, (ii) a material change occurs in the way the customer’s account is operated, (iii) the bank’s policies, procedures or standards relating to the documentation of CDD information change substantially, and (iv) the bank becomes aware that it lacks sufficient information about the customer concerned. 21 6-10-6  The frequency of CDD review may vary depending on each customer’s risk profile. Higher risk customers should be subject to more frequent periodic review (e.g. on an annual basis) to ensure that CDD information such as nationality, passport details, certificate of incumbency, ownership and control information that the bank has previously obtained remain relevant and up-to-date. 6-10-7  In determining what would constitute suspicious, complex, unusually large or unusual pattern of transactions, a bank should consider, amongst others, international typologies and information obtained from law enforcement and other authorities that may point to jurisdiction-specific considerations. As part of ongoing monitoring, a bank should pay attention to transaction characteristics, such as ― (a) the nature of a transaction (e.g. abnormal size or frequency for that customer or peer group); (b) whether a series of transactions is conducted with the intent to avoid reporting thresholds (e.g. by structuring an otherwise single transaction into a number of cash transactions); (c) the geographic destination or origin of a payment (e.g. to or from a higher risk country); and (d) the parties concerned (e.g. a request to make a payment to or from a person on a sanctions list). 6-10-8  A bank’s transaction monitoring processes or systems may vary in scope or sophistication (e.g. using manual spreadsheets to automated and complex systems). The degree of automation or sophistication of processes and systems depends on the size and complexity of the bank’s operations. 6-10-9  Nevertheless, the processes and systems used by the bank should provide its business units (e.g. front office and relationship managers) and compliance officers (including employees and officers who are tasked with conducting investigations) with timely information needed to identify, analyse and effectively monitor customer accounts for ML/TF. 6-10-10 The transaction monitoring processes and systems should enable the bank to monitor multiple accounts of a customer holistically within a business unit and across business units to identify any suspicious transactions. In the event that a business unit discovers suspicious transactions in a customer’s account, such information should be shared across their business units (e.g. Private Banking and Retail Banking business units) to facilitate a holistic assessment of the ML/TF risks presented by the customer. Therefore, banks should have processes in place to share such information across business units. In addition, banks should perform trend analyses of transactions to identify unusual or suspicious transactions. Banks should also monitor transactions with parties in high risk countries or jurisdictions. 22 6-10-11  In addition, banks should have processes in place to monitor related customer accounts holistically within and across business units, so as to better understand the risks associated with such customer groups, identify potential ML/TF risks and report suspicious transactions. 6-10-12  The parameters and thresholds used by a bank to identify suspicious transactions should be properly documented and independently validated to ensure that they are appropriate to its operations and context. A bank should periodically review the appropriateness of the parameters and thresholds used in the monitoring process.\n",

      "6-11 6-11-1  A reference to “specific risks” in paragraph 6.27 of the Notice includes risks arising from establishing business relations and undertaking transactions according to instructions conveyed by customers over the internet, post, fax or telephone. A bank should note that applications and transactions undertaken across the internet may pose greater risks than other non-face-to-face business due to the following factors: (a) the ease of unauthorised access to the facility, across time zones and location; (b) the ease of making multiple fictitious applications without incurring extra cost or the risk of detection; (c) the absence of physical documents; and (d) the speed of electronic transactions, that may, taken together, aggravate the ML/TF risks. 6-11-2  The measures taken by a bank for verification of an identity in respect of nonface- to-face business relations with or transactions for the customer will depend on the nature and characteristics of the product or service provided and the customer’s risk profile. 6-11-3  Where verification of identity is performed without face-to-face contact (e.g. electronically), a bank should apply additional checks to manage the risk of impersonation. The additional checks may consist of robust anti-fraud checks that the bank routinely undertakes as part of its existing procedures, which may include ― 23 (a) telephone contact with the customer at a residential or business number that can be verified independently; (b) confirmation of the customer’s address through an exchange of correspondence or other appropriate method; (c) subject to the customer’s consent, telephone confirmation of the customer’s employment status with his employer’s human resource department at a listed business number of the employer; (d) confirmation of the customer’s salary details by requiring the presentation of recent bank statements from another bank, where applicable; (e) provision of certified identification documents by lawyers or notaries public; or (f) requiring the customer to make an initial deposit into the account with the bank from funds held by the customer in an account with another bank in Singapore.\n",

      "6-15 6-15-1  Screening is intended to be a preventive measure. A bank is reminded that all parties identified pursuant to the Notice are required to be screened, irrespective of the risk profile of the customer. 6-15-2  Where screening results in a positive hit against sanctions lists, a bank is reminded of its obligations to freeze without delay and without prior notice, the funds or other assets of designated persons and entities that it has control over, so as to comply with applicable laws and regulations in Singapore, including the TSOFA, and the regulations issued under section 192 read with section 15(1)(b) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (“FSM Act”) relating to sanctions and freezing of assets of persons2 (“FSM Sanctions Regulations”). Any such assets should be reported promptly to the relevant authorities and a Suspicious Transaction Report (“STR”) should be filed. 6-15-3 A bank should put in place policies, procedures and controls that clearly set out ― (a) the ML/TF information sources used by the bank for screening (including commercial databases used to identify adverse information on individuals and entities, individuals and entities covered under the FSM Sanctions Regulations, individuals and entities identified by other sources such as the bank’s head office or parent supervisory authority, lists and information provided by the Authority and relevant authorities in Singapore); (b) the roles and responsibilities of the bank’s employees involved in the screening, reviewing and dismissing of alerts, maintaining and updating of the various screening databases and escalating hits; (c) the frequency of review of such policies, procedures and controls; (d) the frequency of periodic screening; 2 Including the regulations issued under section 192 read with sections 15(1)(b) and 219(d) of the FSM Act. Please refer to the following link for the relevant Financial Services and Markets Regulations: https://mas.gov.sg/regulation/anti-money- laundering/targeted-financial-sanctions/regulations-for-targeted-financial-sanctions 26 (e) how apparent matches from screening are to be resolved by the bank’s employees, including the process for determining that an apparent match is a positive hit and for dismissing an apparent match as a false hit; and (f) the steps to be taken by the bank’s employees for reporting positive hits to the bank’s senior management and to the relevant authorities. 6-15-4  The level of automation used in the screening process should take into account the nature, size and risk profile of a bank’s business. A bank should be aware of any shortcomings in its automated screening systems. In particular, it is important to consider “fuzzy matching” to identify non-exact matches. The bank should ensure that the fuzzy matching process is calibrated to the risk profile of its business. As application of the fuzzy matching process is likely to result in the generation of an increased number of apparent matches which have to be checked, the bank’s employees will need to have access to CDD information to enable them to exercise their judgment in identifying true hits. 6-15-5 A bank should be aware that performing screening after business relations have been established could lead to a breach of relevant laws and regulations in Singapore relating to sanctioned parties. When the bank becomes aware of such breaches, it should immediately take the necessary actions and inform the relevant authorities. 6-15-6  In screening periodically as required by paragraph 6.40(d) of the Notice, a bank should pay particular attention to changes in customer status (e.g. whether the customer has over time become subject to prohibitions and sanctions) or customer risks (e.g. a connected party of a customer, a beneficial owner of the customer or a natural person appointed to act on behalf of the customer subsequently becomes a Politically Exposed Person or presents higher ML/TF risks, or a customer subsequently becomes a Politically Exposed Person or presents higher ML/TF risks) and assess whether to subject the customer to the appropriate ML/TF risk mitigation measures (e.g. enhanced CDD measures). 6-15-7  A bank should ensure that the identification information of a customer, a connected party of the customer, a natural person appointed to act on behalf of the customer and a beneficial owner of the customer is entered into the bank’s customer database for periodic name screening purposes. This will help the bank to promptly identify any existing customers who have subsequently become higher risk parties. 6-15-8 In determining the frequency of periodic name screening, a bank should consider its customers’ risk profile. 6-15-9  The bank should ensure that it has adequate arrangements to perform screening of the bank’s customer database when there are changes to the lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, covered by the TSOFA, and the FSM Sanctions Regulations. The bank should implement “four-eye checks” on alerts from 27 sanctions reviews before closing an alert, or conduct quality assurance checks on the closure of such alerts on a sample basis. 6-15-10  With reference to paragraph 6.41 of the Notice, transaction screening should take place on a real-time basis [i.e. the screening or filtering of relevant payment instructions (e.g. MT103, MT 202) should be carried out before the transaction is executed]. For intermediary institutions, identification information in the cover payments (e.g. MT202COV) should be screened. 28\n",

      "8-5          PEPs 32 8-5-1 If a bank determines that any natural person appointed to act on behalf of a customer or any connected party of a customer is a PEP, the bank should assess the ML/TF risks presented and consider factors such as the level of influence that the PEP has on the customer. Banks should consider factors such as whether the PEP is able to exercise substantial influence over the customer, to determine the overall ML/TF risks presented by the customer. Where the customer presents higher ML/TF risks, the bank should apply ECDD measures on the customer accordingly. 8-5-2 It is generally acceptable for a bank to refer to commercially available databases to identify PEPs. However, a bank should also obtain from the customer details of his occupation and the name of his employer. In addition, a bank should consider other non-public information that the bank is aware of. A bank shall exercise sound judgment in identifying any PEP, having regard to the risks and the circumstances. 8-5-3 In relation to paragraph 8.3(a) of the Notice, the approval shall be obtained from senior management. Inputs should also be obtained from the bank’s AML/CFT compliance function. 8-5-4 In relation to paragraph 8.3(b) of the Notice, a bank may refer to information sources such as asset and income declarations, which some jurisdictions expect certain senior public officials to file and which often include information about an official’s source of wealth and current business interests. A bank should note that not all declarations are publicly available. A bank should also be aware that certain jurisdictions impose restrictions on their PEPs’ ability to hold foreign bank accounts, to hold other office or paid employment. 8-5-5 Source of wealth generally refers to the origin of the customer’s and beneficial owner’s entire body of wealth (i.e. total assets). This relates to how the customer and beneficial owner have acquired the wealth which is distinct from identifying the assets that they own. Source of wealth information should give an indication about the size of wealth the customer and beneficial owner would be expected to have, and how the customer and beneficial owner acquired the wealth. Although the bank may not have specific information about assets that are not deposited with or processed by the bank, it may be possible to obtain general information from the customer, commercial databases or other open sources. Examples of appropriate and reasonable means of establishing source of wealth are information and documents such as evidence of title, copies of trust deeds, audited accounts, salary details, tax returns and bank statements. 8-5-6 Source of funds refers to the origin of the particular funds or other assets which are the subject of the establishment of business relations (e.g. the amounts being invested, deposited, or wired as part of the business relations). In order to ensure that the funds are not proceeds of crime, the bank should not limit its source of funds inquiry to identifying the other FI from which the funds have been transferred, but more importantly, the activity that generated the funds. The information obtained should be substantive and facilitate the establishment of the provenance 33 of the funds or reason for the funds having been acquired. Examples of appropriate and reasonable means of establishing source of funds are information such as salary payments or sale proceeds. 8-5-7 Based on its risk assessment of the PEP, a bank should consider whether the information regarding source of wealth and source of funds should be corroborated. In relation to paragraph 8.3(b) of the Notice, examples of “appropriate and reasonable means” for establishing source of wealth or source of funds are financial statements of the legal person or legal arrangement owned or controlled by the PEP, site visits, a copy of the will (in cases where the source of wealth or funds is an inheritance), and conveyancing documents (in cases where the source of wealth or funds is a sale of property). 8-5-8 In relation to paragraph 8.3 of the Notice, other ECDD measures that may be performed include ― (a) requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with another FI subject to similar or equivalent CDD standards; (b) using public sources of information (e.g. websites) to gain a better understanding of the reputation of the customer or any beneficial owner of a customer. Where the bank finds information containing allegations of wrongdoing by a customer or a beneficial owner of a customer, the bank should assess how this affects the level of risk associated with the business relations; (c) commissioning external intelligence reports where it is not possible for a bank to easily obtain information through public sources or where there are doubts about the reliability of public information. 8-5-9 In relation to paragraphs 8.4(a) and (b) of the Notice, where the bank assesses that the business relations or transactions with a domestic PEP or an international organisation PEP do not present higher ML/TF risks and that therefore ECDD measures need not be applied, the bank shall nevertheless apply measures under paragraph 6 of the Notice on the customer. However, where changes in events, circumstances or other factors lead to the bank’s assessment that the business relations or transactions with the customer present higher ML/TF risks, the bank should review its risk assessment and apply ECDD measures. 8-5-10  While domestic PEPs and international organisation PEPs may be subject to a risk-based approach, it does not preclude such persons from presenting the same 8-5-11  With reference to paragraph 8.4(c) of the Notice, while the time elapsed since stepping down from a prominent public function is a relevant factor to consider when determining the level of influence a PEP continues to exercise, it should not 34 be the sole determining factor. Other risk factors that the bank should consider are ― (a) the seniority of the position that the individual previously held when he was a (b) whether the individual’s previous PEP position and current function are linked in any way (e.g. whether the ex-PEP was appointed to his current position or function by his successor, or whether the ex-PEP continues to substantively exercise the same powers in his current position or function).\n",

For such customers, the bank shall ensure that the ECDD measures performed are commensurate with the risks. For customers highlighted in paragraph 8.6(b) of the Notice, a bank shall assess whether any such customer presents a higher risk for ML/TF and ensure that the measures under paragraph 6 of the Notice, or ECDD measures where the bank assesses the customer to present a higher risk for ML/TF, performed are commensurate with the risk. 8-6-3 With reference to paragraph 8.6(a) of the Notice, a bank should refer to the FATF Public Statement on High Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action3. FATF updates this Public Statement on a periodic basis and banks should regularly refer to the FATF website for the latest updates4. 8-6-4 For private banking business which inherently presents higher ML/TF risks, a bank should, regardless of the bank’s internal risk classification of the customer, refer to the sound practices highlighted in the MAS Information Paper, “Guidance on Private Banking Controls”5.

Where there are grounds for suspicion in an existing customer relationship, banks should conduct enhanced monitoring and where appropriate, discontinue the relationship. If the bank is inclined to retain the customer, approval shall be obtained from senior management with the substantiating reasons properly documented, and the account subjected to close monitoring and commensurate risk mitigation measures. This requirement applies to serious foreign tax offences, even if the foreign offence is in relation to the type of tax for which an equivalent obligation does not exist in Singapore. Examples of tax crime related suspicious transactions are set out in Appendix B of these 36\n",

      "1-4          Key Concepts 1-4-1 Money laundering (“ML”) is a process intended to mask the benefits derived from criminal conduct so that they appear to have originated from a legitimate source. Singapore’s primary legislation to combat ML is the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992. A bank should refer to the Commercial Affairs Department’s (“CAD”) website for more information. 1-4-2 Generally, the process of ML comprises three stages, namely ― (a) Placement – The physical or financial disposal of the benefits derived from criminal conduct. (b) Layering – The separation of these benefits from their original source by creating layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the ultimate source and transfer of these benefits. (c) Integration – The provision of apparent legitimacy to the benefits derived from criminal conduct. If the layering process succeeds, the integration schemes place the laundered funds back into the economy so that they re-enter the financial system appearing to be legitimate funds.\n",

      "Section   : 2-3\n",
      "Title     : Customer\n",
      "Text:\n",
      "2-3 When performing Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) measures in the scenarios below, the following approaches may be adopted: (a) Portfolio Managers bank may encounter cases where, to its knowledge, the customer is a manager of a portfolio of assets and who is operating the account in that capacity. In such cases, the underlying investors of the portfolio shall be beneficial owners within the meaning of the Notice. However, the Authority recognises that a bank may not be able to perform CDD measures on the underlying investors. For instance, the portfolio manager may be reluctant, for commercial reasons, to reveal information on the underlying investors to the bank. In such circumstances, the bank should evaluate the risks arising from each case and determine the appropriate CDD measures to take. The bank may consider whether simplified CDD (“SCDD”) measures could be applied to underlying investors under paragraph 7 of the Notice. However, where the customer falls within paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, the bank is exempted from making inquiries about the existence of such underlying investors (i.e. beneficial owners). Therefore, the bank does not need to identify and verify such underlying investors. (b) Credit or Charge Card Customers Where a bank issues a credit card or a charge card as defined in section 56 of the Banking Act 1970, or a particular type of credit card or charge card defined in regulation 2 of the Banking (Credit Card and Charge Card) Regulations 2013 (such as a business card, business card with no personal liability, corporate card, guarantee card, corporate card with no personal liability, corporate purchasing card, guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card), the following are customers for the purposes of the Notice: (i) the principal credit card or charge card holder; 6 (ii) any supplementary credit card or charge card holder; (iii) any employee to whom the business card is issued; (iv) the sole proprietor or partnership which bears liability for the business card issued; (v) any employee or officer of a body corporate to whom the corporate card is issued, and the body corporate; and (vi) the guarantor of any guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card. merchant for whom the bank opens or maintains an account (including a ledger account) for the purchase of goods by, or provision of services to, any person from the merchant, using any credit card or charge card, should be considered a customer for the purposes of the Notice. (c) Location of Relationship Management Given the globalised nature of modern banking, it may often be the case that a bank’s relationship and transactions with a particular customer is managed by a bank employee or officer based in one country or jurisdiction but the account itself is held with an office in another country or jurisdiction for bookkeeping purposes. The Authority will generally look at the substance of the relationship management as a whole. A bank should perform the applicable CDD measures if in substance, the relationship or account is managed by an employee or officer of the bank in Singapore even though the account is booked in another country or jurisdiction. However, the bank may rely on the CDD measures carried out by its related entity (or in the case of a branch network, another branch of the bank) in accordance with paragraph 9 of the Notice.\n",

Introduction\\nSection 1-4. \\n1-4          Key Concepts 1-4-1 Money laundering (“ML”) is a process intended to mask the benefits derived from criminal conduct so that they appear to have originated from a legitimate source. Singapore’s primary legislation to combat ML is the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992. A bank should refer to the Commercial Affairs Department’s (“CAD”) website for more information. 1-4-2 Generally, the process of ML comprises three stages, namely ― (a) Placement – The physical or financial disposal of the benefits derived from criminal conduct. (b) Layering – The separation of these benefits from their original source by creating layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the ultimate source and transfer of these benefits. (c) Integration – The provision of apparent legitimacy to the benefits derived from criminal conduct. If the layering process succeeds, the integration schemes place the laundered funds back into the economy so that they re-enter the financial system appearing to be legitimate funds.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Part 2. Notice Paragraph 2 – Definitions, Clarifications and Examples\\nSection 2-3. Customer\\n2-3 When performing Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) measures in the scenarios below, the following approaches may be adopted: (a) Portfolio Managers bank may encounter cases where, to its knowledge, the customer is a manager of a portfolio of assets and who is operating the account in that capacity. In such cases, the underlying investors of the portfolio shall be beneficial owners within the meaning of the Notice. However, the Authority recognises that a bank may not be able to perform CDD measures on the underlying investors. For instance, the portfolio manager may be reluctant, for commercial reasons, to reveal information on the underlying investors to the bank. In such circumstances, the bank should evaluate the risks arising from each case and determine the appropriate CDD measures to take. The bank may consider whether simplified CDD (“SCDD”) measures could be applied to underlying investors under paragraph 7 of the Notice. However, where the customer falls within paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, the bank is exempted from making inquiries about the existence of such underlying investors (i.e. beneficial owners). Therefore, the bank does not need to identify and verify such underlying investors. (b) Credit or Charge Card Customers Where a bank issues a credit card or a charge card as defined in section 56 of the Banking Act 1970, or a particular type of credit card or charge card defined in regulation 2 of the Banking (Credit Card and Charge Card) Regulations 2013 (such as a business card, business card with no personal liability, corporate card, guarantee card, corporate card with no personal liability, corporate purchasing card, guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card), the following are customers for the purposes of the Notice: (i) the principal credit card or charge card holder; 6 (ii) any supplementary credit card or charge card holder; (iii) any employee to whom the business card is issued; (iv) the sole proprietor or partnership which bears liability for the business card issued; (v) any employee or officer of a body corporate to whom the corporate card is issued, and the body corporate; and (vi) the guarantor of any guaranteed credit card or guaranteed charge card. merchant for whom the bank opens or maintains an account (including a ledger account) for the purchase of goods by, or provision of services to, any person from the merchant, using any credit card or charge card, should be considered a customer for the purposes of the Notice. (c) Location of Relationship Management Given the globalised nature of modern banking, it may often be the case that a bank’s relationship and transactions with a particular customer is managed by a bank employee or officer based in one country or jurisdiction but the account itself is held with an office in another country or jurisdiction for bookkeeping purposes. The Authority will generally look at the substance of the relationship management as a whole. A bank should perform the applicable CDD measures if in substance, the relationship or account is managed by an employee or officer of the bank in Singapore even though the account is booked in another country or jurisdiction. However, the bank may rely on the CDD measures carried out by its related entity (or in the case of a branch network, another branch of the bank) in accordance with paragraph 9 of the Notice.',\n",

Notice Paragraph 6.9\\nSection 6-6. \\n6-6 6-6-1 Where the customer is a natural person, a bank should obtain identification documents that contain a clear photograph of that customer. 6-6-2 In verifying the identity of a customer, a bank may obtain the following documents: (a) Natural Persons ― (i) name, unique identification number, date of birth and nationality based on a valid passport or a national identity card that bears a photograph of the customer; and (ii) residential address based on national identity card, recent utility or telephone bill, bank statement or correspondence from a government agency; (b) Legal Persons or Legal Arrangements ― (i) name, legal form, proof of existence and constitution based on certificate of incorporation, certificate of good standing, partnership agreement, trust deed, constitutional document, certificate of registration or any other documentation from a reliable independent source; and (ii) powers that regulate and bind the legal person or arrangement based on memorandum and articles of association, and board resolution authorising the opening of an account and appointment of authorised signatories. 6-6-3 Further guidance on verification of different types of customers (including legal persons or legal arrangements) is set out in Appendix A. 6-6-4 In exceptional circumstances where the bank is unable to retain a copy of the documentation used to verify the customer’s identity, the bank should record the following: (a) information that the original documentation had served to verify; (b) title and description of the original documentation produced to the bank’s employee or officer for verification, including any particular or unique features or condition of that documentation (e.g. whether it is worn out, or damaged); (c) reasons why a copy of that documentation could not be made; and 17 (d) name of the bank’s employee or officer who carried out the verification, a statement by that employee or officer certifying verification of the information against the documentation and the date of the verification. 6-6-5 Where a bank obtains data, documents or information from the customer or a third party, it should ensure that such data, documents or information is current at the time they are provided to the bank. 6-6-6 Where the customer is unable to produce an original document, a bank may consider accepting a copy of the document ― (a) that is certified to be a true copy by a suitably qualified person (e.g. a notary public, a lawyer or certified public or professional accountant); or (b) if a bank staff independent of the customer relationship has confirmed that he has sighted the original document. 6-6-7 Where a document is in a foreign language, appropriate steps should be taken by a bank to be reasonably satisfied that the document does in fact provide evidence of the customer’s identity. The bank should ensure that any document that is critical for performance of any measures required under the Notice is translated into English by a suitably qualified translator. Alternatively, the bank may rely on a translation of such document by a bank staff independent of the customer relationship who is conversant in that foreign language. This is to allow all employees and officers of the bank involved in the performance of any measures required under the Notice to understand the contents of the documents, for effective determination and evaluation of ML/TF risks associated with the customer. 6-6-8 The bank should ensure that documents obtained for performing any measures required under the Notice are clear and legible. This is important for the establishment of a customer’s identity, particularly in situations where business relations are established without face-to-face contact.',\n",

Notice Paragraphs 6.13 to 6.17\\n6-8 6-8-1 A bank should note that measures listed under paragraph 6.14(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) as well as paragraph 6.14(b)(i) and (ii) of the Notice are not alternative measures but are cascading measures with each to be used where the immediately preceding measure has been applied but has not resulted in the identification of a beneficial owner. 6-8-2 In relation to paragraph 6.14(a)(i) and (b)(i) of the Notice, when identifying the natural person who ultimately owns the legal person or legal arrangement, the shareholdings within the ownership structure of the legal person or legal arrangement should be considered. It may be based on a threshold (e.g. any person owning more than 25% of the legal person or legal arrangement, taking into account any aggregated ownership for companies with cross-shareholdings). 6-8-3 A natural person who does not meet the shareholding threshold referred to in paragraph 6-8-2 above but who controls the customer (e.g. through exercising significant influence), is a beneficial owner under the Notice. 6-8-4 A bank may also consider obtaining an undertaking or declaration from the customer on the identity of, and the information relating to, the beneficial owner. Notwithstanding the obtaining of such an undertaking or declaration, the bank remains responsible for complying with its obligations under the Notice to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner by, for example, researching publicly available information on the beneficial owner or arranging a face-to-face meeting with the beneficial owner, to corroborate the undertaking or declaration provided by the customer. 6-8-5 Where the customer is not a natural person and has a complex ownership or control structure, a bank should obtain enough information to sufficiently understand if there are legitimate reasons for such ownership or control structure. 6-8-6 A bank should take particular care when dealing with companies with bearer shares, since the beneficial ownership is difficult to establish. For such companies, a bank should adopt procedures to establish the identities of the beneficial owners of such shares and ensure that the bank is notified whenever there is a change of beneficial owner of such shares. At a minimum, these procedures should require 19 the bank to obtain an undertaking in writing from the beneficial owner of such bearer shares stating that the bank shall be immediately notified if the shares are transferred to another natural person, legal person or legal arrangement. Depending on its risk assessment of the customer, the bank may require that the bearer shares be held by a named custodian, with an undertaking from the custodian that the bank will be notified of any changes to ownership of these shares or the named custodian. 6-8-7 For the purposes of paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, where the customer is a legal person publicly listed on a stock exchange and subject to regulatory disclosure requirements relating to adequate transparency in respect of its beneficial owners (imposed through stock exchange rules, law or other enforceable means), it is not necessary to identify and verify the identities of the beneficial owners of the customer. 6-8-8 In determining if the foreign stock exchange imposes regulatory disclosure and adequate transparency requirements, the bank should put in place an internal assessment process with clear criteria, taking into account, amongst others, the country risk and the level of the country’s compliance with the FATF standards. 6-8-9 Where the customer is a majority-owned subsidiary of a publicly listed legal person, it is not necessary to identify and verify the identities of beneficial owners of the customer. However, for such a customer, if there are other non-publicly listed legal persons who own more than 25% of the customer or who otherwise control the customer, the beneficial owners of such non-publicly listed legal persons should be identified and verified. 6-8-10  Deleted with effect from 30 November 2015. 6-8-11  Deleted with effect from 30 November 2015. 6-8-12  Where a customer is one which falls within paragraph 6.16 of the Notice, this does not in itself constitute an adequate analysis of low ML/TF risks for the purpose of performing SCDD measures under paragraph 7 of the Notice.',\n",

Notice Paragraphs 6.19 to 6.26\\n6-10 6-10-1  Ongoing monitoring of business relations is a fundamental feature of an effective AML/CFT risk management system. Ongoing monitoring should be conducted in relation to all business relations, but the bank may adjust the extent and depth of monitoring of a customer according to the customer’s ML/TF risk profile. The adequacy of monitoring systems and the factors leading the bank to adjust the level of monitoring should be reviewed regularly for effectiveness in mitigating the bank’s ML/TF risks. 6-10-2  A bank should make further enquiries when a customer performs frequent and cumulatively large transactions without any apparent or visible economic or lawful purpose. For example, frequent transfers of funds to the same recipient over a short period of time, multiple deposits of cash such that the amount of each deposit is not substantial, but the total of which is substantial. 6-10-3  Where there are indications that the risks associated with an existing business relations may have increased, the bank should request additional information and conduct a review of the customer’s risk profile in order to determine if additional measures are necessary. 6-10-4  A key part of ongoing monitoring includes maintaining relevant and up-to-date CDD data, documents and information so that the bank can identify changes to the customer’s risk profile ― (a) for higher risk categories of customers, a bank should obtain updated CDD information (including updated copies of the customer’s passport or identity documents if these have expired), as part of its periodic CDD review, or upon the occurrence of a trigger event as deemed necessary by the bank, whichever is earlier; and (b) for all other risk categories of customers, a bank should obtain updated CDD information upon the occurrence of a trigger event. 6-10-5  Examples of trigger events are when (i) a significant transaction takes place, (ii) a material change occurs in the way the customer’s account is operated, (iii) the bank’s policies, procedures or standards relating to the documentation of CDD information change substantially, and (iv) the bank becomes aware that it lacks sufficient information about the customer concerned. 21 6-10-6  The frequency of CDD review may vary depending on each customer’s risk profile. Higher risk customers should be subject to more frequent periodic review (e.g. on an annual basis) to ensure that CDD information such as nationality, passport details, certificate of incumbency, ownership and control information that the bank has previously obtained remain relevant and up-to-date. 6-10-7  In determining what would constitute suspicious, complex, unusually large or unusual pattern of transactions, a bank should consider, amongst others, international typologies and information obtained from law enforcement and other authorities that may point to jurisdiction-specific considerations. As part of ongoing monitoring, a bank should pay attention to transaction characteristics, such as ― (a) the nature of a transaction (e.g. abnormal size or frequency for that customer or peer group); (b) whether a series of transactions is conducted with the intent to avoid reporting thresholds (e.g. by structuring an otherwise single transaction into a number of cash transactions); (c) the geographic destination or origin of a payment (e.g. to or from a higher risk country); and (d) the parties concerned (e.g. a request to make a payment to or from a person on a sanctions list). 6-10-8  A bank’s transaction monitoring processes or systems may vary in scope or sophistication (e.g. using manual spreadsheets to automated and complex systems). The degree of automation or sophistication of processes and systems depends on the size and complexity of the bank’s operations. 6-10-9  Nevertheless, the processes and systems used by the bank should provide its business units (e.g. front office and relationship managers) and compliance officers (including employees and officers who are tasked with conducting investigations) with timely information needed to identify, analyse and effectively monitor customer accounts for ML/TF. 6-10-10 The transaction monitoring processes and systems should enable the bank to monitor multiple accounts of a customer holistically within a business unit and across business units to identify any suspicious transactions. In the event that a business unit discovers suspicious transactions in a customer’s account, such information should be shared across their business units (e.g. Private Banking and Retail Banking business units) to facilitate a holistic assessment of the ML/TF risks presented by the customer. Therefore, banks should have processes in place to share such information across business units. In addition, banks should perform trend analyses of transactions to identify unusual or suspicious transactions. Banks should also monitor transactions with parties in high risk countries or jurisdictions. 22 6-10-11  In addition, banks should have processes in place to monitor related customer accounts holistically within and across business units, so as to better understand the risks associated with such customer groups, identify potential ML/TF risks and report suspicious transactions. 6-10-12  The parameters and thresholds used by a bank to identify suspicious transactions should be properly documented and independently validated to ensure that they are appropriate to its operations and context. A bank should periodically review the appropriateness of the parameters and thresholds used in the monitoring process.',\n",

A bank should note that applications and transactions undertaken across the internet may pose greater risks than other non-face-to-face business due to the following factors: (a) the ease of unauthorised access to the facility, across time zones and location; (b) the ease of making multiple fictitious applications without incurring extra cost or the risk of detection; (c) the absence of physical documents; and (d) the speed of electronic transactions, that may, taken together, aggravate the ML/TF risks. 6-11-2  The measures taken by a bank for verification of an identity in respect of nonface- to-face business relations with or transactions for the customer will depend on the nature and characteristics of the product or service provided and the customer’s risk profile. 6-11-3  Where verification of identity is performed without face-to-face contact (e.g. electronically), a bank should apply additional checks to manage the risk of impersonation. The additional checks may consist of robust anti-fraud checks that the bank routinely undertakes as part of its existing procedures, which may include ― 23 (a) telephone contact with the customer at a residential or business number that can be verified independently; (b) confirmation of the customer’s address through an exchange of correspondence or other appropriate method; (c) subject to the customer’s consent, telephone confirmation of the customer’s employment status with his employer’s human resource department at a listed business number of the employer; (d) confirmation of the customer’s salary details by requiring the presentation of recent bank statements from another bank, where applicable; (e) provision of certified identification documents by lawyers or notaries public; or (f) requiring the customer to make an initial deposit into the account with the bank from funds held by the customer in an account with another bank in Singapore.',\n",

A bank should be aware of any shortcomings in its automated screening systems. In particular, it is important to consider “fuzzy matching” to identify non-exact matches. The bank should ensure that the fuzzy matching process is calibrated to the risk profile of its business. As application of the fuzzy matching process is likely to result in the generation of an increased number of apparent matches which have to be checked, the bank’s employees will need to have access to CDD information to enable them to exercise their judgment in identifying true hits. 6-15-5 A bank should be aware that performing screening after business relations have been established could lead to a breach of relevant laws and regulations in Singapore relating to sanctioned parties. When the bank becomes aware of such breaches, it should immediately take the necessary actions and inform the relevant authorities. 6-15-6  In screening periodically as required by paragraph 6.40(d) of the Notice, a bank should pay particular attention to changes in customer status (e.g. whether the customer has over time become subject to prohibitions and sanctions) or customer risks (e.g. a connected party of a customer, a beneficial owner of the customer or a natural person appointed to act on behalf of the customer subsequently becomes a Politically Exposed Person or presents higher ML/TF risks, or a customer subsequently becomes a Politically Exposed Person or presents higher ML/TF risks) and assess whether to subject the customer to the appropriate ML/TF risk mitigation measures (e.g. enhanced CDD measures). 6-15-7  A bank should ensure that the identification information of a customer, a connected party of the customer, a natural person appointed to act on behalf of the customer and a beneficial owner of the customer is entered into the bank’s customer database for periodic name screening purposes. This will help the bank to promptly identify any existing customers who have subsequently become higher risk parties. 6-15-8 In determining the frequency of periodic name screening, a bank should consider its customers’ risk profile. 6-15-9  The bank should ensure that it has adequate arrangements to perform screening of the bank’s customer database when there are changes to the lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, covered by the TSOFA, and the FSM Sanctions Regulations. The bank should implement “four-eye checks” on alerts from 27 sanctions reviews before closing an alert, or conduct quality assurance checks on the closure of such alerts on a sample basis. 6-15-10  With reference to paragraph 6.41 of the Notice, transaction screening should take place on a real-time basis [i.e. the screening or filtering of relevant payment instructions (e.g. MT103, MT 202) should be carried out before the transaction is executed]. For intermediary institutions, identification information in the cover payments (e.g. MT202COV) should be screened. 28',\n",

Notice Paragraphs 8.2 to 8.4\\n8-5          PEPs 32 8-5-1 If a bank determines that any natural person appointed to act on behalf of a customer or any connected party of a customer is a PEP, the bank should assess the ML/TF risks presented and consider factors such as the level of influence that the PEP has on the customer. Banks should consider factors such as whether the PEP is able to exercise substantial influence over the customer, to determine the overall ML/TF risks presented by the customer. Where the customer presents higher ML/TF risks, the bank should apply ECDD measures on the customer accordingly. 8-5-2 It is generally acceptable for a bank to refer to commercially available databases to identify PEPs. However, a bank should also obtain from the customer details of his occupation and the name of his employer. In addition, a bank should consider other non-public information that the bank is aware of. A bank shall exercise sound judgment in identifying any PEP, having regard to the risks and the circumstances. 8-5-3 In relation to paragraph 8.3(a) of the Notice, the approval shall be obtained from senior management. Inputs should also be obtained from the bank’s AML/CFT compliance function. 8-5-4 In relation to paragraph 8.3(b) of the Notice, a bank may refer to information sources such as asset and income declarations, which some jurisdictions expect certain senior public officials to file and which often include information about an official’s source of wealth and current business interests. A bank should note that not all declarations are publicly available. A bank should also be aware that certain jurisdictions impose restrictions on their PEPs’ ability to hold foreign bank accounts, to hold other office or paid employment. 8-5-5 Source of wealth generally refers to the origin of the customer’s and beneficial owner’s entire body of wealth (i.e. total assets). This relates to how the customer and beneficial owner have acquired the wealth which is distinct from identifying the assets that they own. Source of wealth information should give an indication about the size of wealth the customer and beneficial owner would be expected to have, and how the customer and beneficial owner acquired the wealth. Although the bank may not have specific information about assets that are not deposited with or processed by the bank, it may be possible to obtain general information from the customer, commercial databases or other open sources. Examples of appropriate and reasonable means of establishing source of wealth are information and documents such as evidence of title, copies of trust deeds, audited accounts, salary details, tax returns and bank statements. 8-5-6 Source of funds refers to the origin of the particular funds or other assets which are the subject of the establishment of business relations (e.g. the amounts being invested, deposited, or wired as part of the business relations). In order to ensure that the funds are not proceeds of crime, the bank should not limit its source of funds inquiry to identifying the other FI from which the funds have been transferred, but more importantly, the activity that generated the funds. The information obtained should be substantive and facilitate the establishment of the provenance 33 of the funds or reason for the funds having been acquired. Examples of appropriate and reasonable means of establishing source of funds are information such as salary payments or sale proceeds. 8-5-7 Based on its risk assessment of the PEP, a bank should consider whether the information regarding source of wealth and source of funds should be corroborated. In relation to paragraph 8.3(b) of the Notice, examples of “appropriate and reasonable means” for establishing source of wealth or source of funds are financial statements of the legal person or legal arrangement owned or controlled by the PEP, site visits, a copy of the will (in cases where the source of wealth or funds is an inheritance), and conveyancing documents (in cases where the source of wealth or funds is a sale of property). 8-5-8 In relation to paragraph 8.3 of the Notice, other ECDD measures that may be performed include ― (a) requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with another FI subject to similar or equivalent CDD standards; (b) using public sources of information (e.g. websites) to gain a better understanding of the reputation of the customer or any beneficial owner of a customer. Where the bank finds information containing allegations of wrongdoing by a customer or a beneficial owner of a customer, the bank should assess how this affects the level of risk associated with the business relations; (c) commissioning external intelligence reports where it is not possible for a bank to easily obtain information through public sources or where there are doubts about the reliability of public information. 8-5-9 In relation to paragraphs 8.4(a) and (b) of the Notice, where the bank assesses that the business relations or transactions with a domestic PEP or an international organisation PEP do not present higher ML/TF risks and that therefore ECDD measures need not be applied, the bank shall nevertheless apply measures under paragraph 6 of the Notice on the customer. However, where changes in events, circumstances or other factors lead to the bank’s assessment that the business relations or transactions with the customer present higher ML/TF risks, the bank should review its risk assessment and apply ECDD measures. 8-5-10  While domestic PEPs and international organisation PEPs may be subject to a risk-based approach, it does not preclude such persons from presenting the same 8-5-11  With reference to paragraph 8.4(c) of the Notice, while the time elapsed since stepping down from a prominent public function is a relevant factor to consider when determining the level of influence a PEP continues to exercise, it should not 34 be the sole determining factor. Other risk factors that the bank should consider are ― (a) the seniority of the position that the individual previously held when he was a (b) whether the individual’s previous PEP position and current function are linked in any way (e.g. whether the ex-PEP was appointed to his current position or function by his successor, or whether the ex-PEP continues to substantively exercise the same powers in his current position or function).',\n",

FATF updates this Public Statement on a periodic basis and banks should regularly refer to the FATF website for the latest updates4. 8-6-4 For private banking business which inherently presents higher ML/TF risks, a bank should, regardless of the bank’s internal risk classification of the customer, refer to the sound practices highlighted in the MAS Information Paper, “Guidance on Private Banking Controls”5.

Where there are grounds for suspicion in an existing customer relationship, banks should conduct enhanced monitoring and where appropriate, discontinue the relationship. If the bank is inclined to retain the customer, approval shall be obtained from senior management with the substantiating reasons properly documented, and the account subjected to close monitoring and commensurate risk mitigation measures. This requirement applies to serious foreign tax offences, even if the foreign offence is in relation to the type of tax for which an equivalent obligation does not exist in Singapore. Examples of tax crime related suspicious transactions are set out in Appendix B of these 36',\n",

The scope and frequency of training should be tailored to the specific risks faced by the bank and pitched according to the job functions, responsibilities and experience of the employees and officers. New employees and officers should be required to attend training as soon as possible after being hired or appointed. 15-6-2  Apart from the initial training, a bank should also provide refresher training at least once every two years, or more regularly as appropriate, to ensure that employees and officers are reminded of their responsibilities and are kept informed of new developments related to ML/TF. A bank should maintain the training records for audit purposes. 47 15-6-3  A bank should monitor the effectiveness of the training provided to its employees. (a) testing employees’ understanding of the bank’s policies and procedures to combat ML/TF, their obligations under relevant laws and regulations, and their ability to recognise suspicious transactions; (b) monitoring employees’ compliance with the bank’s AML/CFT policies, procedures and controls as well as the quality and quantity of internal reports so that further training needs may be identified and appropriate action taken; and (c) monitoring attendance and following up with employees who miss such training without reasonable cause. 48 Other Key Topics - Guidance to Banks on Proliferation Financing MAS issues the FSM Sanctions Regulations in order to discharge or facilitate the discharge of any obligation binding on Singapore by virtue of a United Nations Security Council Resolution (“UNSCR”) 8. These Regulations apply to all FIs (including banks) regulated by MAS and generally impose financial sanctions on designated persons. Specifically, a UNSCR may designate certain individuals and entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. The relevant information and full listings of persons designated by UNSCRs can be found on the UN website9. I-1-3        MAS has given effect to UNSCRs as listed by the FATF Recommendations (2012) to be relevant to combating proliferation financing, by issuing the FSM Sanctions Regulations. Examples of such Regulations are the Financial Services and Markets (Sanctions and Freezing of Assets of Persons – Iran) Regulations 2023 and the Financial Services and Markets (Sanctions and Freezing of Assets of Persons – Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations 2023. A bank should rely on its CDD measures (including screening measures) under the Notice to detect and prevent proliferation financing activities and transactions. A bank should also ensure compliance with legal instruments issued by MAS relating to proliferation financing risks. It is important to ensure that name screening by a bank, as required under the Notice, is performed against the latest UN listings as they are updated from time to time. A bank should have in place policies, procedures and controls to continuously monitor the listings and take necessary follow-up action within a reasonable period of time, as required under the applicable laws and regulations. A bank should also have policies and procedures to detect attempts by its employees or officers to circumvent the applicable laws and regulations (including the FSM Sanctions Regulations) such as ― 8 Please refer to the MAS website for a full listing of Regulations issued by MAS pursuant to the United Nations Security 9 Please see: https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list 49 (a) omitting, deleting or altering information in payment messages for the purpose of avoiding detection of that information by the bank itself or other banks involved in the payment process; and (b) structuring transactions with the purpose of concealing the involvement of designated persons. A bank should have policies and procedures to prevent such attempts, and take appropriate measures against such employees and officers. A bank is reminded of its obligations under the FSM Sanctions Regulations to immediately freeze any funds, financial assets or economic resources owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by designated persons that the bank has in its possession, custody or control. The bank should also file an STR in such cases. I-4-1        A bank should develop indicators that would alert it to customers and transactions (actual or proposed) that are possibly associated with proliferation financing- related activities, including indicators such as whether ― (a) the customer is vague and resistant to providing additional information when asked; (b) the customer’s activity does not match its business profile or the end-user information does not match the end-user’s business profile; (c) the transaction involves designated persons; (d) the transaction involves higher risk countries or jurisdictions which are known to be involved in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or proliferation financing activities; (e) the transaction involves other FIs with known deficiencies in AML/CFT controls or controls for combating proliferation financing; (f) the transaction involves possible shell companies (e.g. companies that do not have a high level of capitalisation or display other shell company indicators); (g) the transaction involves containers whose numbers have been changed or ships that have been renamed; 50 (h) the shipment of goods takes a circuitous route or the financial transaction is structured in a circuitous manner; (i) the transaction involves the shipment of goods inconsistent with normal geographic trade patterns (e.g. the country involved would not normally export or import such goods); (j) the transaction involves the shipment of goods incompatible with the technical level of the country to which goods are being shipped (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing equipment shipped to a country with no electronics industry); or (k) there are inconsistencies in the information provided in trade documents and financial flows (e.g. in the names, companies, addresses, ports of call and final destination). The FATF has also provided guidance on measures to combat proliferation financing and a bank may wish to refer to the FATF website for additional information. ………………………….',\n",

Quarterly customer forums were set up, with the objective of gathering customer feedback on the quality of marketing materials and financial advisory experience.

An example is an extremely time limited website promotional offer, accompanied by language highlighting that the limited deal is running out, which could unduly encourage hasty purchases by customers without sufficient consideration of his/her needs or suitability. 3 Where an application is rejected due to money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing concerns, financial institutions should take steps to ensure that their communication with the customer does not constitute “tipping off” under section 57 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.

In making the underwriting decision, the insurer considered information relevant to the risks presented by each applicant through its assessment framework to determine the appropriate underwriting outcome that reflected the risks of each applicant. Whether an application was accepted, declined, or subject to any loading or conditions was based on an objective assessment of relevant information or data. Supervisory expectations: An insurer should carry out an objective assessment of every application based on the set of risks presented by the customer. An example of inappropriate differential treatment would be rejecting an application for insurance of a customer merely based on his/her declaration of autism, disability or mental health condition without having first performed an objective underwriting assessment. The assessment should be properly substantiated by reliable information or data relevant to the risks being insured, such as medical reports, analysis of statistical/actuarial data, or clinical surveys/studies. In this assessment, an insurer may also factor in its underwriting expertise, risk appetite, and guidance from its reinsurer(s). Where an application is rejected or accepted with additional conditions, an insurer should properly explain to the customer the basis for the underwriting decision with reference to the information or data relevant to the risks being insured. This will allow customers to better appreciate the rationale behind the underwriting decision. Guidelines on Fair Dealing | 11',\n",

To measure effectiveness of the initiatives and as a guide to take follow-up actions, they monitored survey results from customers based on their experience of dealing with the financial institution and its representatives. Supervisory expectations: Senior Management should demonstrate its commitment to embed a culture of fair dealing in its organisation and play an active role in communicating its expectations for representatives to consistently act in the customers’ interests. They should also monitor customers’ perception to assess whether these expectations are implemented at all levels of the organisation.

These reports, which identified shortcomings and highlighted possible enhancements to policies and practices, were reviewed by management monthly. In addition, the financial institution conducted regular customer surveys and mystery shopping exercises to track effectiveness of initiatives in ensuring fair outcomes to customers.

The strategy identified the target customer segment to be young executives who had worked for at least a year, and who were in search of wealth accumulation opportunities.    The financial institution further informed its representatives that while the broad target customer segment had been identified, they should note that the product was not suitable for customers who were seeking pure insurance protection, given the product’s high investment element. The financial institution also instructed its Compliance Department to conduct post-sales sampling checks to ensure that the sales made were suitable for its customers. Supervisory expectations: In identifying a target customer segment for the distribution of a financial product or service, a financial institution should be mindful that the product may not suit all customers even within the broad target customer segment. It should communicate this clearly to its representatives and put in place controls to ensure appropriate sales of the product to its customers. Guidelines on Fair Dealing | 18',\n",

       "  'text': 'Part 3. 3 Fair Dealing Outcome Three Customers are served by competent representatives .\\nSection poor-practice-3.3. 3.3 Providing Appropriate Advice and Recommendations\\nPoor practice 3.3 A retiree, aged 67, with poor proficiency in English received a call from a bank representative that his fixed deposit was due for renewal and was invited to visit the bank. The bank representative recommended that he use the proceeds of his fixed deposit to purchase a single premium whole life policy that provided a regular fixed stream of income. The representative further recommended the retiree to take up a bank loan to finance a higher premium amount in order to receive a higher income stream. The representative explained that the income from the whole life policy, after accounting for the interest to be paid on the bank loan, would be higher than the interest he could earn from the fixed deposit. Less than a year later, against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the interest payable for the loan had escalated to an amount which he was not led to expect. The interest payments were now higher than the income stream he received from the life policy. The situation was unsustainable for him as he had retired and did not have any other active income stream. Supervisory expectations: A financial institution should put in place safeguards (e.g., risk profiling, suitability assessment) such that risk appropriate products are recommended. For example, if a customer is seeking to renew or place a fixed deposit, the financial institution should not actively promote investment products to the customer. However, where the customer makes an explicit request for information on investment products, the financial institution can arrange for a representative to advise the customer on the products that are suitable for him. A representative should not recommend that customers take up loans to finance the purchase of investment products unless the representative has conducted a holistic assessment of the customer’s financial situation and his ability to service the loan repayments. For example, a representative should consider if loans are suitable for customers who have limited or irregular income (e.g., retirees, platform workers), and whether these customers are able to sustain the loan repayments if interest rates move adversely or if proceeds from the financed investment product are less than expected. The ease with which customers are able to exit the loan or investment product should also be considered (e.g., whether it is possible to exit the loan without exiting the investment product and vice versa). Risks associated with taking up the financing should be appropriately disclosed and explained, especially those that are associated with interest rates movements and poor performance of the product. The link between the loan and the product that is being financed for purchase should also be clearly explained (e.g., whether the product is used as collateral for the loan). Clear illustrations on the worst-case scenario should be provided. In addition, where vulnerable customers are involved, a financial institution should put in place additional safeguards, such as conducting callbacks to ensure that they understand the implications of the purchase or transaction, or requiring trusted individuals to accompany and assist them in comprehending their purchase or transaction.

This allowed the representative to earn extra commission, at the expense of the customer. Supervisory expectations: A representative should not, out of personal gain, recommend customers to switch from one investment product to another, which may be detrimental to their interests due to the incurrence of additional sales charges or penalties for early termination, or to obtain lower benefits at a higher cost. To curb improper switching, a financial institution should have proper controls, processes and procedures in place to monitor switching practices as set out in MAS’ Guidelines on Switching of Designated Investment Products.

Results from the exercise were factored into the representatives’ remuneration and training. Supervisory expectations: Regular and independent review of the provision of financial advisory services helps uphold the professional standards of representatives, thereby safeguarding customers’ interests. Besides desktop reviews of client surveys and documentation made during the advisory and sales process, a financial institution should conduct regular mystery shopping exercises to validate if its representatives are competent to provide appropriate advice and recommendations to customers.

Supervisory expectations: Differentiating remuneration among different types of investment products may encourage representatives to recommend products without giving due consideration to the needs of customers. This leads to poor market conduct practices such as aggressive product pushing ahead of considering the suitability of the product for the customer. Instead, the financial institution should consider remunerating its representatives based on objective (e.g., the medium-term performance of assets under advice) and conduct indicators (e.g., adequacy of fact-find and reasonableness of advice, number of customer complaints and misconduct), in addition to sales targets.

For example, the possible impact of market movements on products that involve market risk, such as variable interest rates. For products where the customer risks losing a significant portion of or the entire principal amount in return for potentially higher returns, the risk should be clearly highlighted upfront to the customer. This is especially important when customers are opting for products perceived to be alternatives to traditional fixed income investments. For insurance products, information about exclusions should be carefully explained. 9 As an insurance contract relates to a promise that hinges on the likelihood of an uncertain event occurring in the future, contracting parties (i.e., the insurer and the customer) rely on each other to produce all information that is relevant and material to the basis of the contract. Deviating from general insurance law in respect of “ caveat emptor ” (i.e., buyers beware), insurance contracts fall within a special class of contracts which are deemed uberrima fides (utmost good faith). Material non- disclosure by the customer can result in insurance contracts being voided.',\n",

Upon the representative’s recommendation, he decided to purchase a financial product from the financial institution with a long premium payment term. However, the representative did not explain that the higher bonus interest on his savings account would be accorded only for the first 12 months. As a result, the customer did not realise that he would have to pay premiums for a longer duration than the period of bonus interest. This was not in line with his intent or understanding.

However, the representative did not inquire about the customer’s existing medical conditions or go through the health declaration questions in detail. A few months later, the customer suffered a stroke. His claims for the associated medical expenses were rejected, as the customer did not disclose that he had hypertension at the point of application. Supervisory expectations: The principle of utmost good faith 9 applies to insurance contracts, and the onus is on customers to disclose all material facts at point of application. Failure to do so could result in claims being rejected or policies being voided. Given these potentially serious repercussions, the insurer and the representative have to remind customers to disclose material facts relevant in an insurance application, and highlight the consequences of not making a full disclosure.

Customers who had taken such mortgages may have expected that fixed deposit rates would generally move in line with the market conditions and that the bank would not apply a more selective lens to adjusting the rates for particular tenors. Supervisory expectations: When adjusting variable components of its products, a financial institution should do so in a way that considers the risk of being perceived to have misled the customer. In the above example, adjusting interest and mortgage rates in such a selective manner (i.e., revising the fixed deposit rates of all tenors except the tenor which mortgage rates are pegged to) may not be aligned with what customers had been led to expect when purchasing the product or service, and can therefore cause customers be perceive that they have been misled and treated unfairly.',\n",

The approving forum should explicitly consider whether fair dealing outcomes for customers are met, including whether there should be measures to mitigate potential detriment to customers. For instance, the financial institution can consider allowing customers to switch out of the product without financial penalty, or to subscribe to an alternative at no additional cost; and b) provide early notice and in writing, the changes resulting from the exercise of the RoR clause. The written notice should explain the reasons for initiating the changes, impact on customers, and alternatives available to customers. 10 Minimally, the specific circumstances that a financial institution would exercise RoR clauses during the normal course of its business should be disclosed upfront to customers. 11 Depending on the complexity of the changes and how easily customers can find alternative arrangements, financial institutions may take reference from relevant industry norms to guide its assessment on a suitable notice period. For example, the ABS Consumer Guide to Housing Loans and the LIA Code of Life Insurance Practice set out that customers can expect a minimum of 30 days of advance notice should there be changes to the terms and conditions of the agreement. 12 Some examples include (i) a financial institution making revisions to a contractual arrangement or product features in response to events as defined in uncommitted credit facilities, contracts for structured products, or over-the-counter derivatives; and (ii) insurers revising the premiums or benefits of the product in response to circumstances such as material changes in medical inflation or medical advancements.

However, a persistently low interest rate environment had impacted its mortgage portfolio profitability. It relied on an RoR clause in the mortgage contract to raise the floor rate from 0.1% to 1%. The RoR clause stated that the financial institution had the right to review and amend the interest rate, basis of calculation and terms of the mortgage interest rate by giving the customer one month’s notice. The financial institution did not communicate nor state explicitly in its terms and conditions (T&Cs) that the RoR clause covered revisions to the floor rate. As such, customers did not expect the floor rate to change. Supervisory expectations: A financial institution should perform its obligations in accordance with the T&Cs and as it has explained and led customers to expect. A financial institution should give due consideration to factors other than profitability in determining whether RoR clauses should be exercised. For instance, a financial institution should not exercise the RoR where it had under-priced a product and should have rightly factored relevant risk and pricing considerations into its initial product design. Where a financial institution has to revise the T&Cs following the inception of the product, it should assess the impact of the revisions to customers, consider appropriate mitigating measures (e.g., waiving fees if customers choose to exit from the mortgage), clearly communicate such revisions, and provide sufficient notice to customers.
